Identify the tables that have non-default character encoding. You can use the following SQL query to list all the tables in your database along with their character encodings:

SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_COLLATION
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'confluence'
AND TABLE_COLLATION <> (SELECT DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
                        FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
                        WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'confluence');
